            The Mona Lisa 
            is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>.
            Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian
            Renaissance, it has been described as "the best known, the most
            visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most
            parodied work of art in the world".The painting's novel qualities
            include the subject's enigmatic expression, monumentality of the
            composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric
            illusionism.

            The painting has been definitively identified to depict Italian
            noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo.[9] It is painted in oil on a white
            Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the
            Giocondo family, and it is believed he later left it in his will to
            his favored apprentice Sala√¨.[10] It was believed to have been
            painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued
            working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of
            France and is now the property of the French Republic. It has been
            on permanent display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.
